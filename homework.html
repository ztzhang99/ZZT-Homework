			<li>
				Program with machine language according to the following c.<br />
				int_8 a = 1;<br />
				int_8 c = a + 3;
				<ol>
					<li>
						Write your assembly code & machine code<br />
						Answer: (MIPS)
						<ul>
							<li>
								Assembly code:<br />
<pre>
  .data
  a:  .byte
  c:  .byte

  .text
  main:
    la  $s0, a
    addi  $t0, $0, 1
    sw  $t0, 0($s0)
    la  $s1, c
    addi  $t0, $t0, 3
    sw  $t0, 0($s1)

    li  $v0, 10
    syscall
</pre>
							</li>
							<li>
								Machine code:<br />
<pre>
  001000 01000 00000 0000000000000001 #addi
  101011 01000 10000 0000000000000000 #sw
  001000 01000 01000 0000000000000011 #addi
  101011 01000 01001 0000000000000000 #sw
</pre>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle<br />
						Answer:<br />
						<dl>
							<dt>Fetch:</dt>
							<dd>Fetch a line of code from the memory, and store it in IR. Then, add 4(or sth else) to PC.</dd>
							<dt>Decode:</dt>
							<dd>Set different control signal depending on the opcode, and load value from registers(if needed).</dd>
							<dt>Execute:</dt>
							<dd>Do different operations depending on the control signal.</dd>
					</li>
					<li>
						Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU<br />
						Answer:<br />
						<dl>
							<dt>IR:</dt>
							<dd>Store a line of code, which is loaded from memory.</dd>
							<dt>PC:</dt>
							<dd>Record the address of a line of code, which is going to be loaded a clock time later.</dd>
							<dt>ACC:</dt>
							<dd>Temporarily store the result of an add operation. Without ACC, we must store the result to memory and load it back immediately, which is really a waste of time.</dd>
					</li>
					<li>
						Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine<br />
						Answer:<br />
						Both a and c are addresses. Through these addresses, we are able to store and retrieve data to and from memory.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<li>
				简答题
				<ol>
					<li>
						What are stored in memory?<br />
						Answer:<br />
						Generally speaking, data. Instructions are also seen as data.
					</li>
					<li>
						Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?<br />
						Answer:<br />
						No. According to principle of locality, it is not efficient to do so.
					</li>
					<li>
						Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.<br />
						Answer:<br />
						001000 01000 00000 0000000000000001 #addi<br />
						31-26: The opcode of "addi".
						25-21: 8, the sign of register $t0.
						20-16: 0, the sign of register $zero.
						15-0: 1, an immediate number, which will be added to $t0.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<li>
				解释以下词汇
				<ol>
					<li>
						汇编语言(Assembly Language)<br />
						Explaination:<br />
						A low level language. After transformed into machine language by assembler, the code can be directly understood by CPU.
					</li>
					<li>
						编译(Compiler)<br />
						Explaination:<br />
						A process to transform high level language into machine language, which is done by compiler.
					</li>
					<li>
						命令式语言(Imperative programming)<br />
						Explaination:<br />
						A kind of languages like C & C++. These languages are based on the Von Neumann organization.
					</li>
					<li>
						函数编程语言(Functional programming)<br />
						Explaination:<br />
						A kind of languages like Haskell. There is no variable or side effect in these languages. Compiler can do more optimization in these languages than in imperative languages.
					</li>
					<li>
						过程式编程(Procedural programming)<br />
						Explaination:<br />
						The only way of programming which I have programmed.
